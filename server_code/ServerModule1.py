# This is a server module. It runs on the Anvil server,
# rather than in the user's browser.
#
# To allow anvil.server.call() to call functions here, we mark
# them with @anvil.server.callable.
# Here is an example - you can replace it with your own:
#
# @anvil.server.callable
# def say_hello(name):
#   print("Hello, " + name + "!")
#   return 42
#
def send_feedback(name, email, feedback):
  # Send yourself an email each time feedback is submitted
  anvil.email.send(to="noreply@anvil.works", # Change this to your email address!
                   subject=f"Feedback from {name}",
                   text=f"""
                   
  A new person has filled out the feedback form!

  Name: {name}
  Email address: {email}
  Feedback:
  {feedback}
